~~ Remove installed patches

If the system is bootable and you can login to the system, use swremove to uninstall the installed patch bundle and reboot the system.

If system is not bootable:
1.) Boot from previous kernel and remove offending patch using swremove.

Note: If you need to remove the installed patch bundle:
Generate a list of patches to be removed which were installed as part of this change

  # swlist -l product -a install_date | grep 2007MMDD | awk '{print $1}' > /tmp/patches_to_remove.txt

NOTE: In the above line 2007MMDD corresponds to the install date of the patch bundles. 
For example if the install date was Jan 17 2007, then 2007MMDD should read 20070117

NOTE: The list of patches to be removed should be verified to confirm that only patches installed as a result of this change will be removed. 
Check the /tmp/patches_to_remove.txt file against the list of patches installed in the /var/adm/sw/swinstall.log and /var/adm/sw/swagent.log files.

2.) Remove the patches
  # swremove -x mount_all_filesystems=false -x autoreboot=true -f /tmp/patches_to_remove.txt

Progress of the patch removal can be viewed in the swagent.log (until the reboot takes place), eg:
  # tail -f /var/adm/sw/swagent.log

Once the system has rebooted, remove the bundle definitions:

3.) Now generate the bundle definition list including the revision details
  # swlist –l bundle –a install_date | grep 2007MMDD | awk '{print $1}' > /tmp/bundle_def

For every bundle get the revision details
  # swlist –a revision –l bundle "bundle name"

4.) Remove the bundle definitions
  # swremove –x mount_all_filesystems=false "Bundle name".,r="bundle revision"

  e.g.
  # swremove GOLDAPPS11i.,r=B.11.11.0509.429Note: remember the "." After the bundle name

  
~~ Recover from Ignite backup:

  Note: Direct tape boot is not supported on IA systems

    1.) Load the Ignite recovery archive tape media on to tape drive.

    2.) Boot system using Install DVD with the same version of Ignite-UX that is running on the system.

    3.) Once DVD booted, select Install HP-UX option

    4.) And select Media only install & advanced installation options
    [ * ] Media only installation
    [ * ] Advanced Installation (recommended for disk and filesystem

    5.) Next you will get an option to select media from where you want to recover system.
    Here you choose
    [ * ] Boot from CD/DVD, Recover from Tape

Now you will get the option to choose the tape device path and select. 
Then it will load the Ignite recovery archive from tape media and the system will be recovered.

B.4.2 Option 2 (if using Ignite network recovery archive)

If the system is not bootable, the system may need to be recovered using the Ignite network recovery archive.

Ignite-UX Network Recovery of vPar

1.) Set the autoboot flag & kernel path for the target vPar:
  # vparmodify -p <vpar name> -B manual -b /stand/WINSTALL

2.) Set the TERM variable to hpterm:
  # export TERM=hpterm

3. Boot the client vPar system to install:
  # vparboot -p <vpar name> -I 15.xx.yy.zz,/opt/ignite/boot/WINSTALL

4.) When restore is complete, reset the autoboot flag (if desired) and kernel path for the recovered vPar:
  # vparmodify -p <vpar name> -B auto -b /stand/vmunix

5.) Boot the client vPar system to verify:
  # vparboot -p <vpar name>
