Scan/Rescan for SCSI disk

1. Know which scsi host to scan or rescan
    # hwinfo --disk
        - use this command (may not be installed) to see which scsi host you need to scan/rescan
    # find /sys -type d -name "sd?"; ls -l /sys/class/scsi_host
        - alternatively, you can use the above command to identify the scsi host to rescan
    # find /sys -type d -name "sd?"; ls -l /sys/class/scsi_disk
        - alternatively, you can use the above command to identify the scsi disk to rescan
    # rescan-scsi-bus.sh --forcerescan
        - alternative command for SuSE distro to rescan scsi disk

2. Execute the scan or rescan to the scsi host (find new disk)
    # echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/<your_scsi_host>/scan
        - this will do the rescan of the specific scsi host
3. Execute the rescan to the scsi_disk (find new disk size)
    # echo "1" > /sys/class/scsi_disk/<your_scsi_disk>/device/rescan
        - this will do the rescan of the specific scsi host

4. Verify the new disk details
    # fdisk -l
        - to see the new size of the disk
