Temporary Root Access Request Procedure

This is my proposed process of granting full SUDO root access to user of a Linux system in a given date or period.
This process assumes that sudo is in configured and "unixgrp" is a valid group in the system and has "su -" privilege in sudoers file.

The /etc/sudoers should have the following:
    %unixgrp ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/su

The above policy is not the best permission to allow command auditing and security. It is up to you if you want to restrict the user to specific root commands.

The step-by-step procedure below can easily be "menu-based" scripted to avoid any human mistake in executing the commands.

1. Check if "tmpadmin" exist:

    # id tmpadmin
    # finger tmpadmin

2. If "tmpadmin" does not exist create and set the password:

    # useradd -m tmpadmin
    # chage -M 99999 tmpadmin

3. Make sure "tmpadmin" is part of "unixgrp" group

    # usermod -A unixgrp tmpadmin

4. Disable direct login of “tmpadmin”

    # echo “- : tmpadmin : ALL” >> /etc/security/access.conf

5. Check the validity of the "tmpadmin" account

    Linux-based:
    # chage -l tmpadmin | grep "Account Expires"
    Account Expires:        Aug 10, 2015

    AIX:
    lsuser -a expires tmpadmin

- If the account is newly created, set a new password, expiry date and tracker information:

    # passwd tmpadmin

    Linux-based:
    # usermod -e "2015-08-30" -c "TICKET-000100101" tmpadmin

    AIX:
       # chuser expires=0830235915 tmpadmin
    # chuser gecos="TICKET-000100101" tmpadmin

- If the account already expired, set a new password, expiry date and tracker information:

    # passwd tmpadmin

   Linux-based:
    # usermod -e "2015-08-30" -c "TICKET-000100102" tmpadmin
    AIX:
       # chuser expires=0830235915 tmpadmin
    # chuser gecos="TICKET-000100102" tmpadmin

- If the account has not yet expired, check previous tracker ticket for the current password.

    # finger tmpadmin | grep "Name:"
    example:
    Login: tmpadmin                          Name: TICKET-000100103

- If the account expiry date needs to be extended, set a new date and the new tracker information:

   Linux-based:
    # usermod -e "2015-09-30" -c "TICKET-000100104" tmpadmin

    AIX:
       # chuser expires=0930235915 tmpadmin
    # chuser gecos="TICKET-000100104" tmpadmin

6. Securely save the password and send the details to the requester.
    The requester should have his/her own account to login to system.
    To gain root access, user must use "su" and "sudo" as below:

    $ su - tmpadmin
    $ sudo su -


I am developing a simple script to do this https://github.com/etsibala/legacy-scripts/blob/master/tmpadmin-request.sh
