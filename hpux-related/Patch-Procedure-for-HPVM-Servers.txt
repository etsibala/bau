[ -- Patch Procedure for HPVM Servers -- ]
	 document status: in progress, by etsibala_@_gmail.com

~~ Assumption:

HP Integrity Virtual Machine Setup:
  - 1 Host
  - Multiple guest OS running HP-UX instance

~~ Preparation Stage:

  a) Download the patch from HP-UX website
  b) Extract the downloaded patch file or depot file in /var/tmp/patch and run the shar file.
  c) Make sure that you have a recent ignite and data backups of the host and guest OSs
  d) Login to host's MP with a terminal with logging
  e) On the secondary node, verify the server state and record important server settings into a file for your reference.
    # ./admtool-hpux.sh logchk
    # ./admtool-hpux.sh hpinfo email
    Try the above script [here]
  f) Reboot all servers before starting the patching
    1. Shutdown all guest servers
      # shutdown -h -y 0
    2. Reboot the host
      # shutdown -r -y 0
  g) Verify the server states again:
      # ./admtool-hpux.sh logchk
  h) Start all guest servers using "hpvmstart -P < guest_server>"
  i) Verify all application services running on all guest servers
  j) Shutdown all guest servers again to start patching on the host server

~~ On the host server:

1) Insure kernel rebuild is successful:
  # kconfig -e /stand/system.test
  # kconfig -i hpux_test /stand/system.test
2) Check the state of the system patches:
  # swlist -l fileset -a state | grep -v -e "#" -e "configured"
3) Stop Measureware agent and kill ttd daemon
  # mwa stop
  # /opt/perf/bin/ttd -k
4) Stop CDE environment and print spooler
  # /usr/dt/bin/dtconfig -d
  # /usr/dt/bin/dtconfig -kill
  # lpshut
5) Run swinstall to install the patch bundle
  # swinstall -s /var/tmp/patch/depot
    or
  # swinstall -s /var/tmp/patch/patch.depot
6) Choose reboot
7) Verify installed patches:
  # swlist -l bundle | grep -E -i 'gold|qpk'
  # swlist -l product -a install_date | grep < 20090715> | awk '{print $1}'
  # swlist -l bundle -a install_date | grep <20090715> | awk '{print $1}'
  # swlist -a revision -l bundle "bundle name"
8) Start Measureware agent and ttd if not running
  # mwa status
  # ps -ef |grep ttd
9) Enable the CDE:
  # /usr/dt/bin/dtconfig -e
10) Reboot the host server:
  # shutdown -r -y 0
11) Do a post verification of the server state:
  # ./admtool-hpux.sh logchk
  # ./admtool-hpux.sh hpinfo email

~~ On the guest servers:

13) Start all guest servers using "hpvmstart -P < guest_server>"
14) Login to each guest's MP with a terminal with logging using:
  # hpvmconsole -P < guest_server>
15) Stop any application services running on the server
16) Start the patching using the same steps from 1 to 9
17) Reboot the guest server
  # shutdown -r -y 0
18) Do a post verification of the server state:
  # ./admtool-hpux.sh logchk
  # ./admtool-hpux.sh hpinfo email
19) Verify the application services
